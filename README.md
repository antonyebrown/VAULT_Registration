# VAULT 101 Course Registration

This project is a Dash Enterprise app that allows a user to register for an upcoming class.  The class shown is VAULT 101, a 2 day virtual course that serves as an "all-around" introduction and guide to using many of the US Air Force Data Lab's main features: S3 Cloud Storage via Hue, Databricks, Plotly, R Shiny, and Tableau. Students also learn how to quickly manipulate and analyze your data using Python and R.  There are fantastic learning resources available for each one of these topics specifically, but this course is designed to show you end-to-end use cases that will get you comfortable using VAULT in just 2 days. By the end of this course, students will be able to take raw data in various formats, analyze it, and turn it into a useful visualization-- all within the VAULT environment.

The app allows the course administrators to view and collect student registration information.
